# Project Retribution
 Unity project files for Project Retribution (final title TBD)
 
 "Project Retribution" is a single-player movement FPS influenced heavily by F.E.A.R, Max Payne, Hotline Miami,
 and the aesthetics of the early 2000s.
 
 You, a young former assassin, have been betrayed by your syndicate and transformed into a monster.
 Now free from your chains, nothing stands in the way of your roaring rampage of revenge.
 
 The game is currently in a bare-bones prototyping phase with just me working on it.
